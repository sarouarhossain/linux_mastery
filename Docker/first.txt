why docker 
==========

1. production, staging, development environment will be identical. no more "works on my machine".

2. "build once, run everywhere". Ensure that the exact same environment can be deployed wherever Docker is installed, no matter the hardware or operating system.

3. Build a reproducible environment with a very small footprint (usually just your source code and a special file called Dockerfile) that you can share with others.

4. Declare your project's dependencies as a handy YAML file that can be used to setup everything you need at once (e.g. your app server, database, queues, workers etc.).

5. Create a scalable, reliable cluster that can run your entire project across a fleet of heterogeneous physical machines with a few lines of bash (Docker Swarm). ***
